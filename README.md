# CandyMountain
A simple and silly face detection game where you're a candy eater and must eat candies and avoid the shits, before they come into one of your castles.

I re-made this game with my teammate [closerbibi](https://github.com/closerbibi).    
This game is based on [Bunny and Badgers from MineHubWL](https://github.com/MineHubWL/bunny-badgers)
You need to install the newest [Python 2](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](http://pygame.org/) and [Dlib](http://dlib.net/).    

## Todo
* Add multiplayer support
* Add robust face tracking support
* 

## Usage

`Tested under linux, Python 2.7.6, Pygame 1.9.1, and newest Dlib.`

Get your camera ready, and type the following command
```
cd ./CandyMountain
python main.py
```

Now, enjoy it!
